        "This lab demonstrated that advanced RAG systems require careful orchestration of multiple components. The hybrid retrieval approach proved essential - no single method (keyword or vector) performed best across all query types. Re-ranking with cross-encoders significantly improved precision by re-ordering initial retrieval results based on deep query-chunk interactions. The most challenging aspect was handling ambiguous queries like Q3, which revealed the need for query understanding and disambiguation stages in production RAG systems. Future improvements should focus on dynamic alpha selection based on query characteristics and implementing confidence scoring to detect when retrieval quality is insufficient.\n",
